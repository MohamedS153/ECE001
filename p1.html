Artificial Intelligence (AI), the ability of a computer or digital controlled robot to perform tasks usually associated with smart objects. The term is frequently applied to a project to develop systems conferred on humans' distinct intellectual processes, such as the ability to think, discover meaning, generalize, or learn from past experiences. Since the development of the digital computer in the 1940s, it has been demonstrated that computers can be programmed to perform very complex tasks - for example, discovering proof of mathematical theories or playing chess - with great skill.However, despite the continuous progress in computer processing speed and memory capacity, there are as yet no programs that can match human resilience across broader domains or in tasks that require a lot of daily knowledge. On the other hand, some programs have achieved the levels of performance of human experts and professionals in performing specific specific tasks, so that artificial intelligence in this limited sense is found in various applications such as medical diagnostics, computer search engines, voice or handwriting
